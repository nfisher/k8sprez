## 💡 The Idea 

**Fizz Buzz as a Service**

Bring fizz buzz to the masses!




## Objective

.background pods/pods.001.png




## 🔨 Build It

## Docker Build & Publish
🔨 Build It

.code Dockerfile

.code build.sh

: multi-stage Dockerfile build.
: last image entry is the output image.
: distroless allows reduction in image size.
: minimises attack surface within the image.
: improves deployment, MTTR, and scale out through faster download.




## 🏃 Run It

## Overview
🏃 Run It

1. Minimal Pod Spec
1. Requests & Limits
1. Taints & Tolerations
1. Affinity
1. Anti-affinity

## Minimal Pod Spec
🏃 Run It

## Minimal Pod Spec
🏃 Run It

.code pod-001.yaml

: pods are the most basic building block when deploying into a kubernetes cluster.
: standardised labelling make it easier for workload discovery, filtered log output, monitoring, etc.

## Requests & Limits
🏃 Run It

## Requests & Limits
🏃 Run It

.code pod-002.yaml

: scheduler has to look at a number of dimensions to decide where to schedule a pod.
: specifying requests aides the scheduler in ensuring appropriate placement of your workload.
: specifying limits ensure your workload is a good neighbour by constraining the resources it consumes.
: requests inform what node a workload will "fit on", limits are used.

## Taints & Tolerations
🏃 Run It

## Taints & Tolerations
🏃 Run It

Node Taint

.code taint.sh

Pod Toleration

.code pod-003.yaml

: taints are used to deflect workloads from a node.
: tolerations are used to
